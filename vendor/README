README for Textual Resources Used in this Project
-------------------------------------------------

There are four textual resources, all in the public domain, that are in use in this project:
1) Strong's Concordance of the King James Bible (concordance.pdf)
2) Strong's Greek Lexicon (greek_lexicon.xml)
3) Strong's Hebrew Lexicon (hebrew_lexicon.xml)
4) A mapping of Bible book name abbreviations used in Strong's concordance to full book names (book_map.json)

Each file is described in greater detail below.

concordance.pdf
--------------------------------------------------
This file was downloaded from www.indymissionary.com and contains a mapping between words in the KJV Bible and their corresponding Strong's numbers.  Each Strong's number is listed in either the Hebrew (old testament) or Greek (new testament) lexicon.

concordance.txt
--------------------------------------------------
This file was generated from concordance.pdf and includes a few typo fixes.  It should be considered the correct concordance while concordance.pdf is the original and incorrect source.

greek_lexicon.xml
--------------------------------------------------
This file is part of the github project at https://github.com/morphgnt/strongs-dictionary-xml, which was compiled from Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen's transcribed Greek lexicon.  Ulrik's work can also be perused on his website at http://ulrikp.org.

hebrew_lexicon.xml
--------------------------------------------------
This file is part of the github project at https://github.com/openscriptures/HebrewLexicon and includes a number of additional entries not found in the original Strong's lexicon.

book_map.json
--------------------------------------------------
I (Cameron Dutro) created this file as a counterpart to concordance.txt.  It contains a mapping between the abbreviations of Bible books used in the Indy Missionary concordance to full book names.  For example, "Jg" in concordance.txt is mapped to "Judges".
